## 🧠 1. Make Your Resume Algorithm-Friendly

**Keep it simple and machine-readable.**
- Use a **plain, single-column layout** — no images, graphics, or fancy fonts.  
- Avoid **double columns, symbols, or icons** that may confuse parsing software.  
- Use **standard headings** like “Experience,” “Education,” and “Skills.”  
- Choose **common file formats** (PDF or DOCX) and ensure your name is in the filename.

**Why?**  
Recruiter AI systems often misread complex layouts, which can cause your experience or skills to end up in the wrong fields—or be missed entirely.

## ✍️ 2. Write Clearly, Simply, and Quantify Achievements

**Use short, declarative sentences.**
- Focus on measurable results:  
  - Instead of *“Improved network security,”* say *“Reduced incident response time by 35%.”*  
  - Instead of *“Managed projects,”* say *“Delivered 12 security audits ahead of schedule.”*

**Why?**  
AI models score resumes based on clarity and quantifiable impact.

## 🔑 3. Optimise for Keywords (Without Copying the Job Ad)

**Use keywords from the job description**—skills, tools, and frameworks relevant to the role.  
However, **don’t copy it word-for-word**. Aim for **80–90% overlap**, not 100%, or AI filters might flag your resume as spam.

**Example:**  
If the job ad mentions “incident response, ISO 27001, and SIEM,” weave those naturally into your bullet points.

## 🧩 4. List All Your Skills — Even the Obvious Ones

**Include both technical and soft skills.**
- Technical: Python, Splunk, ISO 27001 auditing, MISP, threat hunting  
- Soft: teamwork, communication, leadership  

**Use a dedicated “Skills” section** with bullet points so algorithms can easily scan it.  
AI-driven hiring systems increasingly focus on **skills-based matching** rather than degrees.

---

## 🤖 5. Use AI Tools to Polish Your Resume

Don’t hesitate to **use AI assistants** (like ChatGPT) for:
- Grammar and clarity checks  
- Rewording for conciseness and tone  
- Generating tailored bullet points based on the job ad  

**Tip:** You can even ask AI to assess how well your resume aligns with a specific job post.

---

## 🏢 6. Apply Directly on Company Websites

Whenever possible, **apply directly through the company’s careers page** instead of major job boards.  
Recruiters often prioritise candidates who apply via internal systems — these applications are reviewed first.

**Why?**  
It demonstrates initiative and bypasses third-party filters that may exclude strong candidates.

---

## 👥 7. Network and Engage with Recruiters

Despite automation, **human connections still matter.**
- Employee referrals often **bypass AI filters** and go straight to recruiters.  
- Engage with recruiters on **LinkedIn** or other platforms — it signals to algorithms that you’re active and available.  
- Respond politely to recruiter outreach — it keeps you visible in AI ranking systems.

**Pro tip:** A quick thank-you or connection message can improve visibility for future roles.
