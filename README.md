# GetStarted
I'm often asked how to get into InfoSec, this is a resource to get started.

The resources in this repo outline some of the key disciplines across InfoSec and provide a good base for people new to the industry.

If you think there are resources that need to be added, or that could be replaced with a better resource feel free to let me know.


>Another good list of resources is *Haklukeâ€™s huge list of resources for beginner hackers*  https://labs.detectify.com/2021/08/24/hakluke-list-resources-for-beginner-hackers-2021/ or you could also check out Brian Krebs' (who is a leading cyber security researcher / journalist) opinion on getting into the infosec field here: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/thinking-of-a-cybersecurity-career-read-this/
