# GetStarted
I'm often asked how to get into InfoSec, this is a resource to get started.

The resources in this repo outline some of the key knowledge areas across InfoSec and provide a good base for people new to the industry.

If you think there are resources that need to be added, or that could be replaced with a better resource feel free to let me know.
